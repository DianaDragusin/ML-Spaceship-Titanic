# ML-Spaceship-Titanic
During my participation in the Spaceship Titanic competition on Kaggle, I developed and implemented a solution that achieved an accuracy rate of 0.795. The objective of the project was to predict which passengers were transported to another dimension when the spaceship collided with the spacetime anomaly, using data from .csv files containing passenger information.
